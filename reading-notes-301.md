## Code 301 Reading Notes
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. 
You can then modify your GitHub Pages’ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.

**Create Your Website** 
1. Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.

2. On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
3. Your website’s files will live in a repository named username.github.io (where “username” is your actual GitHub user name).
To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab.
4. GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time has passed, 
you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!


***Making Changes***
One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it. Since this is a very quick change – and your first one – you’re going to make it on the default branch: main.
View the _config.yml file by navigating to it in the Code tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon.
